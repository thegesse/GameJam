# GameJam repo number 1 (hopefully many more to come)
---

## what is this about?

### This repo is dedicated to my first GameJam with my group, I had a bunch of fun and would like to thank them for everything we did and all the fun moments, anyways in this repository you will find: the zip file for our project, updates whether it be bugs, or new maps and also instructions on how to play


## Known bugs

### As of right now there isnt support for macOS, for some computers you may lag or have the game crash after a song ends, or restart the game after you switch audio sources, the main menu also may take a while to load from time to time

## How to play

### The game is based on the Friday night Funkin engine so it plays exactly like that, navigate with the arrow keys and just hit the notes at the correct time 🤓, and if you struggle just get good 🤷‍♂️


## Special thanks

- First off my group for being so patient and helping me so much through my first gameJam. Also for all the work they put in
- To the FnF devs for making such an amazing game
- Hazardous24 for making  What in the funkin
- and notITG for inspiration for our maps
