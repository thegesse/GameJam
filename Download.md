## instructions
### the file is way too big to be posted on github so I'll provide a link to a google drive to get the zip file from there. Once downloaded you just have to extract the files and open them to execute the notFNF.exe you may get a warning but it is safe
### to open and play, we have tested and played the maps alot during the gamejam.
